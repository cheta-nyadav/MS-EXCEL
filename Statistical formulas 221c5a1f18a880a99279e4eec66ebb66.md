### Q1. Calculate the total no of transactions per each state. (COUNTIF)

so we need to count the number of transactions only, so we need to count the no of occurrences of each state, and use count or to be more specific count if.

step1. Get all distinct state names from there.

1. copy the state col to a new col.
2. use remove dulicates to get distinct states
3. use COUNTIF to sum the state transactions.

### Q2. Calculate total trans. by each state and prod category (COUNTIFS)

so we need 2 level of aggregating, by state and prd category. so weâ€™ll find distinct states and distinct prod category, then we can represent them as either:

| Maharashtra | Furniture |
| --- | --- |
|  | Stationery |
|  | Clothing |
|  | Groceries |
|  | Electronics |
| Tamil Nadu | Furniture |
|  | Stationery |
|  | Clothing |
|  | Groceries |
|  | Electronics |
| Karnataka | Furniture |
|  | Stationery |
|  | Clothing |
|  | Groceries |
|  | Electronics |

|  | **Furniture** | **Stationery** | **Clothing** | **Groceries** | **Electronics** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Maharashtra** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Tamil Nadu** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Karnataka** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Gujarat** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Delhi** |  |  |  |  |  |

sow have two condition, one on state and one on prod category, so we use COUNTIFS instead,

=countifs($D:$D,$O17,$F:$F,P$16)

for expanding along a row, we need to fix $ col,and vice versa
